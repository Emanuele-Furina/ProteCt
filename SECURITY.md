# Security Policy

### Introduction

This security policy outlines the procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities in the "ProteCt++" project. The security of our software is a top priority, and we appreciate the community's contributions to keeping our project secure.
Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the "ProteCt++" project, we encourage you to report it responsibly by following the guidelines below:

1.	Private Reporting: Do not create public issues or pull requests that describe the vulnerability. Instead, send a private report via email to **emanuele.furina@istitutoagnelli.it**.
   
2.	Information to Include:
-	Detailed description of the vulnerability.
-	Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
-	Potential impact of the vulnerability.
-	Any suggestions for fixing the issue.
  
**Response Time:** We commit to responding to your report within 5 business days. We will keep you updated on the status of your report and the progress in resolving the vulnerability.
Resolution Process

1.	Assessment: The report will be assessed by our security team to confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity.
2.	Fix Development: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to develop a fix as quickly as possible.
3.	Testing: The fix will be tested to ensure it resolves the vulnerability without introducing new issues.
4.	Release: Once testing is complete, the fix will be released in a new version of the software. We will notify you when the fix is available.
   
### Reporter Responsibilities

We ask reporters to:
-	Not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been resolved.
-	Provide detailed and clear information to help us understand and resolve the vulnerability.
-	Collaborate with us during the resolution process.
